            <p>We were tasked with designing a digital twin of a UC San Diego classroom so students physically present could enter the Metaverse with students not present and interact with each other in real time.</p>

                <p>Our first steps involved observing products currently available to VR users for metaverse professional collaboration.</p>
                <p>From these insights, we were able to identify the best features available which we would include in our design.</p>
                <p>I was responsible for refining the original Revit model to match the built environment. We aligned a point cloud scan to our Unreal model, allowing us to reference the real classroom as we designed the virtual one.</p>
                <p>I also added critical details to the model with Unreal Engine; adding custom textures and importing BIM models of furniture and other classroom accessories into the virtual environment.</p>
