            <p>For ENG 100D: Design for Development, in partnership with Global TIES: University of California San Diego, my highly interdisciplinary group collaborated with a 4th grade teacher at High Tech Elementary in Chula Vista.</p>
            <p>We designed an interactive classroom activity to teach students about the life cycle of objects, emphasizing sustainability.</p>

            <p>In my role as Creative Director for the team, I proposed giving each student the opportunity to "weave" using recycled fabric and handmade cardboard looms.</p>
            <p>Building upon this inspiration, we decided to simulate each step in the cycle of objects: Material Extraction, Manufacturing, Shipping, Use, and End-of-Life.</p>

            <p>To better meet our objective of addressing several of the United Nations' Sustainable Development Goals through this project, I coded an interactive pollution visualizer with JavaScript to illustrate emissions at each step of the cycle.</p> 
            <p>This increased student engagement while highlighting the environmental costs involved.</p>

                <p>USER RESEARCH & PROFILE:</p> 
                <p>Before we began designing, we visited the classroom onsite twice to meet the students and their teacher and see how their educational experience was designed.</p>
                <p>This was critical to the success of our solution since it gave us a better understanding of the kinds of activities and interactions with which the students might better engage.</p>

                <p>GROUP IDEATION:</p> 
                <p>As a group of 5 with very different academic backgrounds, we had a wide range of potential solutions to the learning challenge.</p>
                <p>Using Google Jamboard, we had an open brainstorm session (a la IDEO) to come up with as many ideas as we could.</p>
                <p>Then, we each had 2 dots to place next to our favorite ideas.</p>
                <p>After we decided on recreating the process of creating, using, and disposing of an object, we used the dots again to decide which object to focus on.</p>

                <p>RAPID PROTOTYPING / PROOF OF CONCEPT:</p> 
                <p>Based on an activity I had tried at a local gallery during San Diego Design Week, I suggested making cardboard looms so each student could have the hands-on experience of weaving.</p>
                <p>This became the central feature of the final solution we designed.</p>
